MouseEvent button attribute is now an IntEnum
`````````````````````````````````````````````

The :attr:`button` attribute of `~.MouseEvent` instances can take the values
None, 1 (left button), 2 (middle button), 3 (right button), "up" (scroll), and
"down" (scroll).  For better legibility, the 1, 2, and 3 values are now
represented using the `IntEnum` class `matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseButton`,
with the values `MouseButton.LEFT` (``== 1``), `MouseButton.MIDDLE` (``== 2``),
and `MouseButton.RIGHT` (``== 3``).
