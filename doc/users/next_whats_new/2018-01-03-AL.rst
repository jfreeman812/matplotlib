*pil_kwargs* argument to savefig
````````````````````````````````

Matplotlib uses Pillow to handle saving to the JPEG and TIFF formats.  The
`~Figure.savefig()` function gained a *pil_kwargs* keyword argument, which can
be used to forward arguments to Pillow's `PIL.Image.save()`.

The *pil_kwargs* argument can also be used when saving to PNG.  In that case,
Matplotlib also uses Pillow's `PIL.Image.save()` instead of going through its
own builtin PNG support.
