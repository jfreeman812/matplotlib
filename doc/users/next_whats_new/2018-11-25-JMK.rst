New `~.scale.FuncScale` added for arbitrary axes scales
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

A new `~.scale.FuncScale` class was added (and `~.scale.FuncTransform`)
to allow the user to have arbitrary scale transformations without having to
write a new subclass of `~.scale.ScaleBase`.  This can be accessed by
``ax.set_yscale('function', functions=(forward, inverse))``, where
``forward`` and ``inverse`` are callables that return the scale transform and
its inverse.  See the last example in :doc:`/gallery/scales/scales`.
