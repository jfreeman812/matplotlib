Improved formatting of image values under cursor when a colorbar is present
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

When a colorbar is present, its formatter is now used to format the image
values under the mouse cursor in the status bar.  For example, for an image
displaying the values 10,000 and 10,001, the statusbar will now (using default
settings) display the values as ``0.0+1e4`` and ``1.0+1e4`` (or ``10000.0``
and ``10001.0`` if the offset-text is disabled on the colorbar), whereas both
values were previously displayed as ``1e+04``.
