Stricter `~.Axes.plot` format string parsing
````````````````````````````````````````````

In certain cases, `~.Axes.plot` would previously accept format strings
specifying more than one linestyle (e.g. ``"---."`` which specifies both
``"--"`` and ``"-."``); only use one of them would be used.

This now raises a ValueError instead.
