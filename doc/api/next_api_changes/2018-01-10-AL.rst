Changes in parameter names
``````````````````````````

- The ``arg`` parameter to `matplotlib.use` has been renamed to ``backend``.
- The ``normed`` parameter to `Axes.hist2d` has been renamed to ``density``.
- The ``s`` parameter to `Annotation` (and indirectly `Axes.annotation`) has
  been renamed to ``text``.
- The ``tolerence`` parameter to
  `bezier.find_bezier_t_intersecting_with_closedpath`,
  `bezier.split_bezier_intersecting_with_closedpath`,
  `bezier.find_r_to_boundary_of_closedpath`,
  `bezier.split_path_inout` and `bezier.check_if_parallel` has been renamed to
  ``tolerance``.

In each case, the old parameter name remains supported (it cannot be used
simultaneously with the new name), but suppport for it will be dropped in
Matplotlib 3.3.

Deprecations
````````````

The ``bezier.find_r_to_boundary_of_closedpath`` function is deprecated (it has
always returned None instead of the requested radius).
