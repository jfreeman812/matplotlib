Deprecations
````````````

Support for passing colors as UPPERCASE strings is deprecated; color names will
become case-sensitive (all-lowercase) after the deprecation period has passed.

The goal is to decrease the number of ambiguous cases when using the ``data``
keyword to plotting methods; e.g. ``plot("X", "Y", data={"X": ..., "Y": ...})``
will not warn about "Y" possibly being a color anymore after the deprecation
period has passed.
