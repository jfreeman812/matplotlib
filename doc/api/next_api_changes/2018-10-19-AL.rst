`FontManager.score_weight` is more strict with its inputs
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, when a weight string was passed to `FontManager.score_weight`,

- if the weight was the string representation of an integer, it would be
  converted to that integer,
- otherwise, if the weight was not a standard weight name, it would be silently
  replaced by a value of 500 ("normal" weight).

`FontManager.score_weight` now raises an exception on such inputs.
