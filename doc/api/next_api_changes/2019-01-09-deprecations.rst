Deprecations
````````````

The ``matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive`` interface has changed from
the (Sphinx-)deprecated function-based interface to a class-based interface.
This should not affect end users, but the
``matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive.plot_directive`` function is now
deprecated.
