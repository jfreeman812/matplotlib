New `Formatter.format_ticks` method
```````````````````````````````````

The `Formatter` class gained a new `~Formatter.format_ticks` method, which
takes the list of all tick locations as a single argument and returns the list
of all formatted values.  It is called by the axis tick handling code and, by
default, repeatedly calls `~Formatter.__call__`.

It is intended to be overridden by `Formatter` subclasses for which
the formatting of a tick value depends on other tick values, such as
`ConciseDateFormatter`.
