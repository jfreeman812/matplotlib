``Cn`` colors now support ``n>=10``
```````````````````````````````````

It is now possible to go beyond the tenth color in the property cycle using
``Cn`` syntax, e.g. ``plt.plot([1, 2], color="C11")`` now uses the 12th color
in the cycle.

Note that previously, a construct such as ``plt.plot([1, 2], "C11")`` would be
interpreted as a request to use color ``C1`` and marker ``1`` (an "inverted Y").
To obtain such a plot, one should now use ``plt.plot([1, 2], "1C1")`` (so that
the first "1" gets correctly interpreted as a marker specification), or, more
explicitly, ``plt.plot([1, 2], marker="1", color="C1")``.
