Setting the same artist property multiple time via aliases is deprecated
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, code such as ``plt.plot([0, 1], c="red", color="blue")`` would
emit a warning indicating that ``c`` and ``color`` are aliases of one another,
and only keep the ``color`` kwarg.  This behavior is deprecated; in a future
version, this will raise a TypeError, similarly to Python's behavior when a
keyword argument is passed twice (``plt.plot([0, 1], c="red", c="blue")``).

This warning is raised by `~.cbook.normalize_kwargs`.

Artist.set now normalizes keywords before sorting them
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

`Artist.set` currently sorts its keyword arguments in reverse alphabetical
order (with a special-case to put ``color`` at the end) before applying them.

It now normalizes aliases (and, as above, emits a warning on duplicate
properties) before doing the sorting (so ``c`` goes to the end too).
